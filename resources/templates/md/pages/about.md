### Hi, I'm Daniel.
I'm a programmer working as a clojure developer out of a small firm in Oslo, Norway.
I am passionate about code, [FOSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software),
 games, music and art. Combined where appropriate.

### Languages
I have experience in Clojure/script, Java, Javascript, C#, Bash/Zsh, CSS/SASS/SCSS, HTML and lesser experience with Python and Perl.

My editor of choice is Vim. I've considered jumping ship and using Emacs but I just couldn't.
